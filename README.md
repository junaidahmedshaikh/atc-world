## 🚀 Overview
This project is a fully responsive group page layout built with Next.js and TypeScript, styled using Bootstrap 5. The layout is a pixel-perfect implementation of a Figma design for both desktop and mobile views. The primary focus is on proper element positioning and responsive behavior without any distortion during window resizing.
